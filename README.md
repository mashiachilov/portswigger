# 🛡️ PortSwigger Web Security Academy Solvers (Python Edition)

This repository contains **Python scripts** designed to automate and solve challenges from the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security), including some that typically require **Burp Suite Professional**.

💡 **Why?**  
Because automation is king. These scripts allow you to complete or assist with solving challenges **without relying on Burp Pro** — perfect for Red Teamers, CTFers, and security researchers who want flexibility and speed.

## ⚙️ What This Is

- 🐍 Python scripts to **automate challenge interaction**
- 💬 Scripts are clean, readable, and fully commented
- 🧠 Meant for **educational** and **ethical** hacking purposes
- 🛠️ Mostly built with `requests`, `re`, `bs4`, and sometimes raw sockets

---

## ❌ What This Is NOT

- Not a dump of “answers” or solution codes
- Not copy-paste exploits — these are logic-focused implementations
- Not dependent on Burp Suite Pro or browser automation (unless noted)

---

## 🔍 Covered Challenge Areas

- SQL Injection (classic, blind, UNION, time-based)
- XSS (reflected, stored, DOM-based)
- Access Control / Broken Auth
- SSRF / Open Redirect
- Web cache poisoning
- Lab-specific automation via Python

Each script targets a **specific PortSwigger lab**, and its filename reflects the goal, e.g.:

Created my mashiachilov 
I might have used AI every now and then
